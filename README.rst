uninhibited
===========

Dead simple event handling for Python; minus the straight jacket.

-  Extensible; Batteries included, not required.
-  Prioritized based handlers. Or ``set``. Or ``list``. Or any
   ``iterable``.
-  Replacable container implementation.

Docs
----

The code is simple, tiny, and straight forward including doctests.

Async
-----

This is a rough as of yet, asynchronous iterators just aren't there yet
in Python ``3.5.1``.

Python ``3.5.2`` (``rc1`` at time of writing) happens to fix most of my
grievances with them, however, so expect some changes here going
forward.
