uninhibited
===========

Dead simple event handling for Python; minus the straight jacket.

* Extensible; Batteries included, not required.
* Prioritized based handlers. Or `set`. Or `list`. Or any `iterable`.
* Replacable container implementation.


Docs
----

The code is simple, tiny, and straight forward including doctests.


Async
-----

This is a rough as of yet, asynchronous iterators just aren't there yet in Python `3.5.1`.

Python `3.5.2` (`rc1` at time of writing) happens to fix most of my grievances with them, however,
so expect some changes here going forward.
